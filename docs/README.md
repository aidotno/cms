# Devise

## What is Devise?

Devise is a package designed to harness the power of Laravel and make it easier for you, the developer, to provide your customers with a robust content management system *incredibly fast*. Like, lightning fast. By implementing Devise for your clients you give them the ability to utilize portions of your design in infinite ways, implement custom content or content from one of their models, create A|B tests and, maybe most importantly, measure what those changes mean.
