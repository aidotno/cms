# Getting Started with Devise

## A Quick About

Well, you are here! Thank you for taking the time to check out Devise. So, what is Devise? You may have already read that Devise gives you the power to take your Laravel applications to the next level for your customer's content management abilities while also giving you the ability to very rapidly develop and iterate.


## A longer About

Have you ever worked on a project where your client asks for you to make some random element on their site content manageable? What about a time where they wanted to use a design pattern from Page "Q" on Page "B"? Have you ever had a request for localized content or A|B testing and thought "Yeah, I can do that but... I don't really want to."? Devise handles these use cases. It frees you and, quite frankly, your clients to be more creative, have more control, and focus on developing new and more effective content.

Devise does this by providing your clients with a super-slick, highly customizable, JavaScript UI to build pages, manage users, and change data on the fly. What is Devise under the hood? Essentially, Devise is a Vue JS application riding on a bunch of API's that reside in a Laravel Package. The Vue JS app is technically a plugin that you can couple with your custom Vue JS applications if you wish which makes Devise highly customizable.
