Ok, so we expect that you have a Laravel installation somewhere you can work on it and have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) installed globally. If this isn't the case take a look at the [full installation instructions](full-installation-instructions.md)

## Add Devise to Composer

Run the following from your project directory

```$ composer require devisephp/cms:~2.0```
